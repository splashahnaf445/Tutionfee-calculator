# Tutionfee-calculator
I have made a tution fee calculator (updated with the current data as of february 2025 (Spring '25) ) for CSE departmenet of three universities BRACU, UIU and NSU.  I have used JAVA and GUI application to make it user interactive. The application will ask the user his/her CGPA, number of credits taken and will show the total cost for the nex trimester along with the total cost for graduation without any waiver. Note that this application will also cover waiver/scolarship requirements for the resprective universities and show the cost accordingly.
